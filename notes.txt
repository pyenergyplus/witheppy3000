If ipython is running the wrong version of python, then:

Run hash -r
From your bash shell, run::

    hash -r

And try running iPython again.

When you've run iPython previously in a shell session, that command was cached. This command simply resets the cache. And now when you run::

    ipython

it will refer to the version of iPython that you installed in your virtual environment.
